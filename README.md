Project Description and Team Roles
The purpose of this project is to migrate a React application from JavaScript to TypeScript to improve code quality and maintainability. Each team member played a crucial role in this transition:

Daniela: Was responsible for integrating TypeScript across the entire codebase. This included typing props, state, and functions to ensure more robust and maintainable code. 
Daniela also organized the project structure, ensuring that all components were correctly placed in their respective folders and that imports were accurate. Additionally, 
she conducted thorough testing to verify that the application functioned correctly.

Alejandra: Focused on adding TypeScript to the createBoard function, using an interface called Image. This interface specifies the details of the image and its numeric identifier, 
which are key for ensuring correct card duplication in the application.

Carolina: Created the initial repository and translated two functions from the Board component to TypeScript. Additionally, 
managed the deployment of the project to Netlify, facilitating its access and online visualization. In the DevOps domain, 
handled the setup and maintenance of the continuous integration environment, ensuring that the project builds and deploys efficiently and automatically.
